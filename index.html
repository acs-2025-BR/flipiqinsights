      FlipIQ Insights is a lightweight reporting tool that generates research summaries for shop owners based on their own Etsy sales data. The application does not alter or manage listings and is not a dashboard or marketplace replacement. It simply retrieves authorized shop data through the Etsy Open API and presents it in a private report format to help sellers better understand trends and performance.
